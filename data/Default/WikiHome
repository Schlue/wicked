A WikiWikiWeb is a site where everyone can collaborate on the content. The most well-known and widely used Wiki is the Portland Pattern Repository at http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki?WikiWikiWeb.

You and I will find these statements there particularly relevant:

''The point is to make the EditPage form simple and the ((Search)) search fast.''

''In addition to being quick, this site also aspires to Zen ideals generally labeled WabiSabi. Zen finds beauty in the imperfect and ephemeral. When it comes down to it, that's all you need.''

''The Universe tends toward chaos. The Universe tends toward Wiki.''

You can say hello on RecentVisitors, or read about HowToUseWiki and AddingPages. Currently this Wiki has no theme for discussion, so go ahead and play with it and have fun!
