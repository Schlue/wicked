 Installing Wicked 0.1
=======================

:Last update:   $Date: 2007/06/19 09:56:39 $

This document contains instructions for installing the Wicked web-based Wiki
application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Wicked, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Wicked distribution.


Obtaining Wicked
================

Wicked can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server, at

   http://www.horde.org/wicked/

   ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/wicked/

Or use the mirror closest to you:

   http://www.horde.org/mirrors.php

Bleeding-edge development versions of Wicked are available via CVS; see the
file `horde/docs/HACKING`_, or the website http://www.horde.org/source/, for
information on accessing the Horde CVS repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Wicked **requires** the following:

1. A working Horde installation

   Wicked runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common
   tools for Web applications written in PHP. You must install Horde before
   installing Wicked.

   .. Important:: Wicked requires version 3.2+ of the Horde Framework -
                  earlier versions of Horde will **not** work.

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Wicked's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.

   .. Important:: Be sure to have completed all of the steps in the
                  `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ file for the Horde Framework before
                  installing Wicked.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

2. SQL support in PHP

   Wicked stores its data in an SQL database. Build PHP with whichever
   SQL driver you require; see the Horde INSTALL file for details.

3. The Text_Wiki PEAR module (>= 1.2.0)

   This can be installed using the ``pear`` command-line program with the
   following command::

   	pear install Text_Wiki

   Wicked currently requires a version greater than 1.0.0 of Text_Wiki to
   function correctly with full charset support. Earlier versions might work
   if you only use pure ascii texts.


Installing Wicked
=================

Wicked is written in PHP, and must be installed in a web-accessible directory.
The precise location of this directory will differ from system to system.
Conventionally, Wicked is installed directly underneath Horde in the web
server's document tree.

Since Wicked is written in PHP, there is no compilation necessary; simply
expand the distribution where you want it to reside and rename the root
directory of the distribution to whatever you wish to appear in the URL.  For
example, with the Apache web server's default document root of
``/usr/local/apache/htdocs``, you would type::

   cd /usr/local/apache/htdocs/horde
   tar zxvf /path/to/wicked-0.1.tar.gz
   mv wicked-0.1 wicked

and would then find Wicked at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/wicked/


Configuring Wicked
==================

1. Configuring Horde for Wicked

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the applications['wicked']
      stanza.  The ``status`` parameter must be marked ``=> active``.  If you
      have changed the location of Wicked relative to Horde, either in the URL
      or in the filesystem or both, you must update the ``fileroot`` and
      ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

2. Creating the database table

   The specific steps to create the Wicked database table depend on which
   database you've chosen to use.

   First, look in ``scripts/sql/`` to see if a script already exists for
   your database type.  If so, you should be able to simply execute that
   script as superuser in your database.  (Note that executing the script as
   the ``horde`` user will probably fail when granting privileges.)

   If such a script does not exist, you'll need to build your own, using the
   file wicked.sql as a starting point.  If you need assistance in creating
   databases, you may wish to let us know on the Wicked mailing list.

3. Configuring Wicked

   To configure Wicked, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration ``dist`` files
   without the ``dist`` suffix::

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Or on Windows::

      copy *.dist *.

   Documentation on the format and purpose of those files can be found in each
   file.  You may edit these files if you wish to customize Wicked's
   appearance and behavior.  With the exception of the ``conf.*`` files (see
   below), the defaults will be correct for most sites.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the configuring
   of Wicked.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get to the
   administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to get
   the configuration page.  Select ``Wiki`` from the selection list of
   applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as needed.  When
   done click on ``Generate Wiki Configuration`` to generate the ``conf.php``
   file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions to the Wicked
   configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write the file.  In
   this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one of the other methods
   to create the configuration file ``wicked/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Wicked uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the ``po/`` directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), or if you're having trouble using a
   provided translation, please see the `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for
   instructions.

4. Testing Wicked

   Test at least the following:

   - Modify a page
   - Create a new page via a WikiLink
   - Delete a page

URL Styles
==========
Wicked can use two forms of URL's; mod_rewrite style, or GET style.
Your web server must have mod_rewrite enabled to use the mod_rewrite
style.  Apache Servers or Apache Proxy Servers  may also need to have
AllowEncodedSlashes and/or AcceptPathInfo enabled to use the mod_rewrite
style.  The GET style URL's should work without any special configuration.

Obtaining Support
=================

If you encounter problems with Wicked, help is available!
