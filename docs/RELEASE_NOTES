The Horde Team is pleased to announce the second release candidate of the Wicked
wiki application version H5 (2.0.0).

Wicked is a wiki application for the Horde Framework. It uses PEAR's Text_Wiki
library for the actual wiki markup parsing and rendering. It supports Creole,
Mediawiki, Tiki Wiki, and its own markup engine. For more information on
Wicked, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/wicked.

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/wicked/docs/INSTALL

Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.
Updated translations would also be great.

The major changes compared to the Wicked version H5 (2.0.0RC1) are:
    * Request CAPTCHA when creating pages.
    * Fixed listing of most recent changes.
