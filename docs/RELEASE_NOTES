The Horde Team is pleased to announce the first release candidate of the Wicked
wiki application version H5 (2.0.8).

Wicked is a wiki application for the Horde Framework. It uses PEAR's Text_Wiki
library for the actual wiki markup parsing and rendering. It supports Creole,
Mediawiki, Tiki Wiki, and its own markup engine. For more information on
Wicked, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/wicked.

Barring any problems, this code will be released as Wicked H5 (2.0.8).
Testing is requested and comments are encouraged.

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see
http://www.horde.org/apps/wicked/docs/INSTALL

The major changes compared to the Wicked version H5 (2.0.7) are:
    * Bundle Text_Wiki library.
    * Improve PHP 7 compatibility.
