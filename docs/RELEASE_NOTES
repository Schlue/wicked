The Horde Team is pleased to announce the final release of the Wicked wiki
application version H5 (2.0.9).

Wicked is a wiki application for the Horde Framework. It uses PEAR's Text_Wiki
library for the actual wiki markup parsing and rendering. It supports Creole,
Mediawiki, Tiki Wiki, and its own markup engine. For more information on
Wicked, visit http://www.horde.org/apps/wicked.

For detailed installation and configuration instructions, please see

Thanks to Gh05tPT (https://www.openbugbounty.org/researchers/Gh05tPT/) for
reporting the XSS vulnerability.

The major changes compared to the Wicked version H5 (2.0.7) are:
    * Fixed XSS vulnerability when downloading attachments of pages.
    * Improved download of ReST and plain text page versions.
    * Fixed PHP 7.4 deprecation warnings.
